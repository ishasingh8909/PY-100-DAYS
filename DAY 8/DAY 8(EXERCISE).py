# Create a function called life_in_weeks() using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, 
# if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

def life_in_weeks(age):
    weeks_left = (90*52)-(age*52)
    print(f"You have {weeks_left} weeks left.")
    
life_in_weeks(20)
